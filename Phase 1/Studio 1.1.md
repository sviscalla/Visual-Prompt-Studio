**Assignment title:** Visual Prompt Studio Phase 1.1

**Prompt:** Create a large-scale billboard created painted with acrylic, located near an urban animal shelter, designed as a form of protest against puppy mills. The billboard is located next to the shelter so that when people drive by it makes them think about how they will meet a new pet. Its message is to discourage buying from a puppy mill and encourage adoption because when someone purchases a puppy from a breeder, the dog that was perfect for them waiting in the shelter dies. The subject matter includes, the cruel ways puppy mills are run, the unknowing person buying a puppy, and all the dogs that die because people decided purchasing from a breeder or pet store which could be a potential puppy mill is better than adopting a dog in need and saving a life. The form is organic with the style representational. There needs to be a light and dark contrast symbolizing how dark the dog´s world is versus what the person sees when they shop from a pet store.
