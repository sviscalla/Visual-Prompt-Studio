Create an image where the medium of the painting is oil on canvas and the subject matter is religious and the calling of st. matthew. There are variations of light and dark shown by the light streaming through the window with people on the right side of the painting in shadow as the light shines on the rest. The light symbolizes Jesus calling St. Matthew while the dark symbolizes the call of the world. The characters have brights colors on that bring them out against the rest of the scene.
